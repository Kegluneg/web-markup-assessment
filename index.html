        <article class="paragraph">
            <p>Amsterdam is a city known for its canals, parks filled with nature and museums it’s also the capital of The Netherlands, country known worldwide for its tulip exports. No matter what time of the year
               you pick to visit Amsterdam, you have multiple activities you can choose from.</p>
            <p>During spring you can visit the tulip fields and, if you schedule your visit during April, you can attend the tulip festival. Also, during this season of blooming you can visit any of the numerous 
               parks scattered all around the city.</p>
            <p>Summer is an ideal time for outdoor activities like music festivals, boat rides or visit any of the many beaches. If you plan to visit during Autumn, make sure to bring an umbrella as it is a rainy 
               season but that doesn’t mean there are less things to do. Weeks can go by in the blink of an eye while visiting any of the many museums Amsterdam ahs to offer.</p>
            <p>During winter the city dresses in lights and decorations, it becomes a truly magical experience.</p>

        <header><h3>BOOS EN LOMMER</h3></header>
        <article class="paragraph">
            <P>Bos en Lommer is one of the neighbourhoods in Amsterdam but it’s packed with fun activities for all ages. Starting with the youngest ones, Candy Castle is a fantastic playground for kids, whether 
               there’s an unexpected rainy day or you need to take a break from the energetic little ones this place is sure to have you covered. Het Lab (The lab) is also a playground of sorts, it’s more focused
               on climbing, if your kids aren’t so small anymore it also has a kid’s playground and a bar where you can sit, relax and enjoy a drink while the kids play.</P> 
            <p>For group activities or for an older audience Bos en Lommer has many escape rooms like Logic Locks, Escape-O-holics, Backspace, etc. which are sure to keep you and your friends or family engaged
               in puzzle solving fun for hours.</p> 
            <P>If you’re not really a part of the escape room fan crowd then perhaps Podium Mozaiek sounds more appealing, it is a theatre right in the heart of Bos en Lommer where you can attend diverse cultural 
               events from theatre performances to cabaret music, dance or even spoken word performances like a poetry festival, it as a small restaurant with a terrace so you can enjoy a bite while taking in the 
               sunlight.</p>
            <p>There’s also a tour of sorts, Amsterdam Odyssey doesn’t really take you sightseeing but rather it focuses on guiding you through the streets of Amsterdam where day to day life happens, 
               it’s the perfect way to get to know the real city, they offer options to customize your experience and discover the real city as you want to. No man’s art gallery and bar offers a place where you 
               can admire the works of art from a wide range of artists from all around the world while also enjoying the culinary work from the chef who periodically changes the menu, it’s an excellent place to 
               visit if you enjoy modern art, good food or both together.</p>
            <p>Finally, we have the Bos en Lommer flea market, nice place to spend some time in between activities and find some food made by local people as well as fruit or cheap clothing, perhaps not a tourist 
               attraction but a nice way to connect with the heart and soul of the neighbourhood.</P>
